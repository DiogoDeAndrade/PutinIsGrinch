# PUTIN IS GRINCH

![Switchess](screenshots/screen01.png)

Developed for the Game Creator's Club at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme was a random one from suggestions (think Secret Santa but with themes), and I got Putin Is Grinch.
Since I didn't have much time to work on the game, I decided to try using AI image generation for this.

I used [Crayon] and [Midjourney]. [Midjourney] is much more impressive than [Crayon], but in both cases it's extremely hard to control the results, so 
some of the images in the end game are just rubish because I couldn't get them to match with each other, etc. It was a fun exercise in any case.
Some of the prompts used:
* Crayon: "pixel-art reindeer from the side"
* Crayon: "pixel-art santa claus sitting down"
* Crayon: "pixel-art cloud"
* Crayon: "pixel-art santa's sledge seen from the side"
* Crayon: "pixel-art putin riding seen from the side"
* Midjourney: "vladimir putin in a crashed sledge with fire and smoke in the background"
* Midjourney: "Putin stealing sledge full of gifts in the middle of the night while reindeers look in alarm in the style of pixel art"
* Midjourney: "Putin sneaking next to sledge full of gifts in the middle on the night in the style of pixel art"
* Midjourney: "putin sneaking in front of sleigh full of gifts in the night in pixel art"

I also took the opportunity to roll a new kit bashing system (for a workshop I'm giving in a couple of months). This is just a prototype, so it will change before that.
